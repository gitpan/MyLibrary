INSTALL

This is the INSTALL file for MyLibrary version 3.x.

MyLibrary is a set of object-oriented Perl modules providing specific
I/O functions against a specifically designed relational database -- a
digital library framework and toolbox. Since MyLibrary uses the Perl DBI
module, MyLibrary is independent of the underlying database application.
We use MySQL.

In order to install MyLibrary you MUST create and initilize a MyLibrary
database before running the normal perl Makefile.PL, make, make test,
and make install commands. Otherwise the tests will fail. Below is an
outline of the required steps using MySQL as an example:

  1. Install Perl.
  
  2. Install MySQL.
  
  3. Install the Perl module called DBI.
  
  4. Install the Perl module DBD::mysql.

  5. Decide on a name for your database - This is easy. We use
     mylibrary, but since the modules support mulitiple instances you
     might want to use mylibrary001, mylibrary002, etc.

  6. Create your database - This can be done using the mysqladmin
     utility:

      $ mysqladmin -uroot -p create mylibrary

  7. Initialize your database - This means giving your database
     structure. It can be done from the root of the MyLibrary
     distribution using the mysql client:

      $ mysql -uroot -p mylibrary < etc/mylibrary-mysql-schema.sql

  8. Assign permissions to the database - This is done through the
     use of the SQL GRANT command. Use the mysql client to log into
     the mysql database and then GRANT permissions for a specific
     user against the mylibrary database:

      $ mysql -uroot -p mysql
      mysql> GRANT SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT ON mylibrary.* TO 'nobody'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'nobody';

  9. Configure MyLibrary - This is done by editing
     lib/MyLibrary/Config.pm and changing the values of $DATA_SOURCE,
     $USERNAME, and $PASSWORD as follows:

      * $USERNAME - The username you denoted in Step #8.
      * $PASSWORD - The password you denoted in Step #8.
      * $DATA_SOURCE - This is the "DSN" for the database.
        If you have used the examples above as a template,
        then the value for $DATA_SOURCE would be
        DBI:mysql:mylibrary:localhost
     
Now you can use the normal installation procedure to make, test, and
install MyLibrary:

  1. perl Makefile.PL
  2. make
  3. make test
  4. make install

After installation consult the POD documentation/tutorial:

  perldoc MyLibrary::Tutorial

Also visit the MyLibrary home page where you will find sample scripts,
applications, and more documentation:
